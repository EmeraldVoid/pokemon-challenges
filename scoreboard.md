**Pokémon Showdown Scoreboard** is a game mode designed and created by the YouTuber [Hardyt3kyoyo](https://www.youtube.com/@Hardyt3kyoyo). The challenge is described as:  
*"A unique competition show... between each of my Pokémon on my own team."*

## 📜 Rules  

1. **Team Selection**  
   - A team of 6 [randomly generated Pokémon](https://randompokemon.com/) (from all generations) is selected and added to [Pokémon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/).  
   - Every Pokémon is legal except for past seasons' *Hall of Fame* Pokémon.  

2. **Tier Selection**  
   - The team will compete in the tier of its highest-tiered Pokémon.  
   - Example: If a team has five *Barely Used* Pokémon and one *Uber*-tiered Pokémon, the entire team must play in the *Ubers* tier.  

3. **Matches & Eliminations**  
   - Each team plays **three (3) games**, earning points based on in-game performance.  
   - At the end of the three games, the Pokémon with the lowest score is eliminated and a new Pokémon must be generated to take it's place.  
   - Any Pokémon that survives **10 streams** is added to the [*Hall of Fame*](https://github.com/EmeraldVoid/hall-of-fame/blob/3c8dcbc6b1677146f46edca1bd1fd57d6a2696b9/hall-of-fame.md).
   - Once **six Pokémon** enter the *Hall of Fame*, the season ends with a **Hall of Fame Special**, where the newly inducted team competes in three final matches.

## 🎯 Scoring System  

Pokémon earn (or lose) points based on their performance in battle:  

| Action | Points Awarded |
|---------|--------------|
| Knocking out an opponent's Pokémon | +2 |
| Getting knocked out by an opponent | -1 |
| Landing a critical hit | +1 |
| Being knocked out by a critical hit *(Sympathy Point: negates -1 KO penalty)* | +1 |
| Inflicting a non-guaranteed status effect or stat drop *(e.g., Fire Blast causing burn)* | +1 |
| Being affected by a non-guaranteed status effect or stat drop | -1 |
| Dodging an opponent's attack | +1 |
| Missing an attack | -1 |
| Using a *Team-Assisting Move* *(e.g., Stealth Rock, Spikes, Aromatherapy, etc.)* | +1 |
| "Phasing" out a buffed opponent *(e.g., using Whirlwind to remove a Swords Dance boost)* | +1 |
| Opponent forfeits while your Pokémon are alive | +1 (for all remaining Pokémon) |

## 🏅 Assist Points  

Assist Points are awarded when a Pokémon directly contributes to a knockout.  

### Example:  
- **Pokémon A** uses *Toxic* on an enemy before being knocked out.  
- **Pokémon B** switches in and weakens the poisoned enemy to low HP.  
- The enemy faints due to poison damage.  
- **Pokémon B** earns **+1 point** for the knockout.  
- **Pokémon A** earns **+1 Assist Point** for contributing to the KO.  

Assist Points can make a difference in close elimination rounds!
