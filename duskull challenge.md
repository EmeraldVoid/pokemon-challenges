The **Duskull Challenge** is a custom self-imposed challenge for **[Pokémon Infinite Fusion](https://github.com/infinitefusion/infinitefusion-e18/releases)**, created by **Emerald_Void**. Inspired by **Kaizo Ironmon** and **Nuzlocke** rules, this challenge offers a unique difficulty by limiting all fusions to a single Pokémon—Duskull.  

By only allowing fusions with Duskull, team composition becomes a key strategic element. You must account for **consistent Ghost-type strengths and weaknesses** while also adapting to the secondary typing of each fused Pokémon. For example:  

- **Ghost** is weak to **Ghost** and **Dark**  
- A **Ghost/Fire** fusion remains weak to Ghost and Dark but also gains weaknesses to **Water, Ground, and Rock**  

This challenge is **flexible**—while originally designed for Duskull, you can substitute another Pokémon of your choice. Want to do a **Charizard fusion run** instead? Go for it! Some Pokémon may not be available early on, but the challenge rules below provide guidance on how to handle those situations. 

Be sure and check out the [Emerald_Void](https://www.twitch.tv/emerald_void) twitch channel to see this run in action.
