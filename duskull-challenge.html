        <p>The <strong>Duskull Challenge</strong> is a custom self-imposed challenge for <strong><a href="https://github.com/infinitefusion/infinitefusion-e18/releases">Pokémon Infinite Fusion</a></strong>, created by <strong>Emerald_Void</strong>. Inspired by <strong>Kaizo Ironmon</strong> and <strong>Nuzlocke</strong> rules, this challenge offers a unique difficulty by limiting all fusions to a single Pokémon—Duskull.</p>

        <p>By only allowing fusions with Duskull, team composition becomes a key strategic element. You must account for <strong>consistent Ghost-type strengths and weaknesses</strong> while also adapting to the secondary typing of each fused Pokémon. For example:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ghost</strong> is weak to <strong>Ghost</strong> and <strong>Dark</strong></li>
          <li>A <strong>Ghost/Fire</strong> fusion remains weak to Ghost and Dark but also gains weaknesses to <strong>Water, Ground, and Rock</strong></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This challenge is <strong>flexible</strong>—while originally designed for Duskull, you can substitute another Pokémon of your choice. Want to do a <strong>Charizard fusion run</strong> instead? Go for it! Some Pokémon may not be available early on, but the challenge rules below provide guidance on how to handle those situations.</p>
        
        <p>Be sure and check out the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/emerald_void">Emerald_Void</a> twitch channel to see this run in action.</p>
